# Contributing to eShop

Thank you for your interest in contributing to eShop! We're excited to collaborate with you and see how together we can improve and evolve this sample application.

## Getting Started

If this is your first visit, a great way to begin is by tackling issues tagged as `"help wanted"` or `"good first issue"`. These are specially curated to help you get acquainted with the project and make a meaningful impact early on.

## Spot a Typo?

Typos and other small fixes are important to us -â€” no contribution is too small! If you spot something small, go ahead and open a Pull Request. For these types of contributions, there's no need to create a separate issue.

## Have a Suggestion?

If you have a suggestion on how to enhance eShop, please open an issue with the following details:
- A clear title and description of the suggestion
- Any relevant examples or mockups
- Indicate whether you're interested in implementing the feature yourself

We'll review your suggestion and have a discussion about its potential inclusion in the project.
